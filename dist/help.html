        <h2>Timeout</h2>
        <p>A timeout is normally caused by the mgmt instance being inaccessible. Check your connection, and if using a
            VPN, make sure you did not log out.
            <h2>Forbidden (403)</h2>
            <p>This is caused by a lack of permissions. You may need to log in to be able to complete the requested action.
            </p>
            <h2>Service Unavailable (503/0)</h2>
            <p>There are many probable causes, some of which are not related to the user instance. Try reloading the page,
                checking the URL, and if the problem persists,
                try again later or contact the developer.
            </p>
            <h2>Botched CSV imports</h2>
            <p>
                Please check if the uploaded file adheres to the requested format. It must contain at least one column (two for renaming operations),
                and each new PV must belong to a new row.
            </p>
            <h2>Other errors</h2>
            <p>Some other errors could arise during normal utilization. Please check you have the certificate for the
                address you're visiting added as an exception to your
                browser, and that you have not cleared any important browser information. In general, a page reload should
                suffice.

        <h1 class="darkGrey">General Information</h1>
        <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>The selected operation is applied to every listed PV, separated by commas. Spaces are ignored, in order to
            avoid errors. In case one PV fails, the requested
            operation will still be performed (or attempted) for every other listed PV.
        </p>
        <h2>Request order</h2>
        <p>Requests are sent in batches in order to speed up execution. Therefore, the processed PVs count may increase by more than one PV at once.
            In order to determine what shall be done with each specific PV, a preliminary status check occurs (displayed as "Fetching PV Listing...").
        </p>
        <h2>Undoing</h2>
        <p>All operations are <b>final</b>, especially deletions, as they take miliseconds to perform. Once you click
            apply, it should be understood that you cannot
            cancel the operation midway, considering the execution time. Be careful, especially with deletions.</p>
        <h2>Reporting Problems</h2>
        <p>For unexpected errors that you believe are not related to your end, please contact the developer. Useful
            information can be found in the console (F12 key),
            adding an image of what the console looks like at the time of execution facilitates reproducing problems
            while developing. If possible, add your browser, OS
            and what you were trying to do at the time.
